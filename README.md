# MyNotes Backend

## Overview
Welcome to the backend of the MyNotes application, a robust cloud-based platform dedicated to efficient note management. This backend serves as the core of the system, providing essential functionalities with a focus on stringent security measures. Leveraging a blend of cutting-edge technologies such as Express, MongoDB, and more, it ensures reliability, scalability, and optimal performance.

## Features
### Backend Innovations
- **Secure Password Storage**: Implemented Bcryptjs to enhance data protection by securely encrypting user passwords, safeguarding sensitive information.
- **Comprehensive Integration Testing**: Conducted thorough integration testing for all APIs to ensure seamless functionality and reliability, enhancing overall system stability.
- **Middleware for JWT Verification**: Utilized middleware for JWT verification, bolstering system security by validating user authentication tokens.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting to prevent API misuse, ensuring system stability and mitigating the risk of abuse.
- **Paginated API Response**: Implemented paginated API response to efficiently manage and retrieve large datasets, enhancing system performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: Provides the robust backend framework for building scalable and efficient web applications.
- **MongoDB**: Serves as the flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing and managing user data and notes.
- **Bcryptjs**: Implements password hashing and encryption for enhanced security of user credentials.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Utilized for secure authentication and authorization of users accessing the application.
- **Middleware**: Employed middleware functions to enhance the functionality and security of the backend APIs.
- **Rate-Limiter-Flexible**: Used for implementing rate limiting to prevent API misuse and ensure system stability.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the backend server locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the MyNotes backend repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Environment Variables**: Create a .env file in the root directory and specify the necessary environment variables, including database connection URI, JWT secret, etc.
4. **Run the Server**: Start the backend server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Access the API**: Once the server is up and running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate them with the frontend of the MERN MyNotes application.
